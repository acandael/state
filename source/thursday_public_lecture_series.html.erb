      “A Social Ontology of Democracy”</strong></p>
    <p>7:30 PM – 9:00 PM; Faculty Council Room, Faculty of Law and Criminology, Volderstraat 3, Ghent.</p>
    <p>Abstract<br>
    This talk presents an account of the social foundations of a theory of democracy. It purports to show that a social ontology is the necessary counterpart of a political theory of democracy. This goal, I contend, can be achieved through a social theory whose main pillars are provided by the three notions of habits, patterns of interaction, and forms of social organization. In the talk I will examine these three notions from the standpoint of a variety of approaches that subscribe to interactionist views of social life. </p>
